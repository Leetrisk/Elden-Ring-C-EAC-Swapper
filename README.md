# Elden-Ring-C-EAC-Swapper
a simple UI to swap EAC on and off for Elden Ring.. written in c#

# To Use, Place the .EXE in a FRESH/VERIFIED Elden Ring Base Folder

> - it would be wise to delete the backup folders every update
> - I may add kill elden ring process / update to the UI in future, or maybe not cos im lazy
> - you can download the source so do whatever you want with it, (sorry for poor code, i am a noob)
