# To Use, Place the .EXE in a FRESH/VERIFIED Elden Ring Base Folder

> - The PAGE 1 method works better than 2nd page, it lets hexinton cheat table work fully- without issues, everytime you launch this program the 2nd page method will always have *active* EasyAntiCheat, page 1 won't- this can obviously be toggled
> - This program should now update the backup exes automatically whenever there is a newer / changed version- if you bump into any issues, please let me know
> - the colour/theme is now randomized, but you can add whatever color you want to the el2theme.txt, these are based off System.Drawing.Color colors https://i.stack.imgur.com/lsuz4.png
> - unless there is an actual problem with the program i will no longer be adding fixes, or features (most likely)

The launch button on the program, will launch it from the exe used in the method for that page
